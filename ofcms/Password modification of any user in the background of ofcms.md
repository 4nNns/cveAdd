In the respwd method, the passwords entered twice will be compared first. If they are inconsistent, they will be returned directly. If they are consistent, the passwords will be encrypted by Sha256Hash and then set to the Record object. The Record object encapsulates a Map object, and you can get and set it. The most important thing is that you also get the user_ The id is also set to the Record object. Then execute Db update。 User_ The ID is used as the update condition to obtain the user from the record_ ID, and then the user in record_ The ID is actually the user passed in from outside_ id 。 So you can control the user_ Id to reset any user password.
